# fastform

Nothing to brag about. This is a repo for my work on a Udacity senior web dev nano degree.
The work is all about functionality - thus it's ugly as sin.

You can see a running version of this form [here](http://107.170.163.81:8080/)

###If you really want to clone and run it:

- The backend is Clojure / Compojure so make sure you have [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) installed.
- Persistence with SQLite
- Clone and start with 'lein repl' from the base dir.
- In the repl - do (in-ns 'fastform.server)
- => (-main)
- You should now have a server running. Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and behold.
